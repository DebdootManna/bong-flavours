# Checkout Auto-Fill Feature

## Overview

The checkout page now automatically fills billing/delivery information from the user's profile data stored in the database. This eliminates the need for users to manually enter their details every time they place an order.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Profile Data Loading
- When a user visits the checkout page, their saved profile information is automatically fetched from the database
- The following fields are auto-populated:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address
  - Phone Number
  - Delivery Address
  - City
  - PIN Code

### 2. Loading States and User Feedback
- Loading indicator appears while profile data is being fetched
- Success message confirms when data has been loaded successfully
- Error handling with fallback to basic user information (name and email from auth context)

### 3. Refresh Functionality
- "Refresh Info" button allows users to reload their profile data manually
- Useful when users have updated their profile in another tab/session

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Helpful placeholders guide users on expected input format
- Link to profile page for users who need to update their information
- Clear messaging about auto-filled data

### 5. Form Validation
- All existing validation rules are maintained
- Users can still edit auto-filled information before submitting
- Required field validation ensures data completeness

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates and navigates to checkout page
2. `fetchUserProfile()` function calls `/api/auth/profile-v2` endpoint
3. User data is retrieved from MongoDB via the User model
4. Form fields are populated with user's saved information
5. User can modify fields as needed before order submission

### API Integration
- Uses existing `/api/auth/profile-v2` endpoint
- Supports both cookie and bearer token authentication
- Handles authentication errors gracefully

### State Management
- `deliveryInfo` state object contains all form data
- `isLoadingProfile` state tracks profile loading status
- `profileLoadSuccess` state provides user feedback
- Form validation state remains independent

### Error Handling
- Network errors fall back to basic user info from auth context
- Invalid tokens are handled with appropriate error messages
- Profile fetch failures don't break the checkout flow

## User Benefits

1. **Time Saving**: No need to repeatedly enter delivery information
2. **Reduced Errors**: Auto-filled data reduces typos and missing information
3. **Better UX**: Seamless experience from profile management to order placement
4. **Flexibility**: Users can still modify information for specific orders

## Files Modified

### `/src/app/app/checkout/page.tsx`
- Added `fetchUserProfile()` function with useCallback hook
- Implemented loading states and success feedback
- Added refresh functionality and profile page navigation
- Enhanced form with helpful placeholders
- Fixed API response data structure access

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies added
- Uses existing authentication and API infrastructure
- Maintains compatibility with existing cart and order systems

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Ensure your profile is complete in the user dashboard
2. Navigate to checkout - your information will auto-fill
3. Review and modify details if needed for this specific order
4. Use "Refresh Info" if you've recently updated your profile
5. Complete your order as usual

### For Developers
1. The feature automatically works with existing user authentication
2. Profile data structure follows the existing User model schema
3. Error handling ensures graceful degradation if profile fetch fails
4. Loading states provide clear feedback to users

## Future Enhancements

1. **Address Book**: Support multiple saved addresses
2. **Smart Defaults**: Remember user's preferred delivery preferences
3. **One-Click Checkout**: Pre-fill payment information for return customers
4. **Address Validation**: Integrate with postal service APIs for address verification
5. **Guest Checkout**: Option to save information for guest users

## Testing Scenarios

1. **New User**: Basic info (name, email) should auto-fill
2. **Complete Profile**: All fields should auto-fill from saved data
3. **Incomplete Profile**: Available fields auto-fill, others show placeholders
4. **Network Error**: Graceful fallback to basic user information
5. **Profile Update**: Refresh button should load updated information
6. **Multiple Sessions**: Profile changes in one tab reflect when refreshed in another

## Security Considerations

- Profile data is fetched using authenticated API calls
- No sensitive information is cached in local storage
- Token-based authentication ensures data security
- User can only access their own profile data
