2. Locate the user you want to delete
3. Click the "Delete" button
4. Confirm deletion in the dialog
5. Wait for success notification

#### Important Notes

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Validation
- Prevents self-modification attempts
- Confirms destructive actions
- Validates required fields
- Provides clear error messages

### Server-Side Security
- Authenticates every request
- Validates admin permissions
- Prevents self-modification
- Returns appropriate error codes

### Common Error Scenarios
| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| "Cannot change your own role" | Admin trying to modify own role | Another admin must make the change |
| "Cannot delete your own account" | Admin trying to delete themselves | Another admin must delete the account |
| "Access denied" | Non-admin user accessing endpoint | User must have admin role |
| "User not found" | Invalid user ID | Refresh page and try again |

## Database Changes

### No Schema Changes Required
- Uses existing User model
- Leverages existing role field
- No new collections or fields needed
- Backward compatible with existing data

## Testing Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Successful Operations
1. **Admin promotes customer**: Customer role changes to admin
2. **Admin demotes admin**: Admin role changes to customer
3. **Admin deletes customer**: Customer account is removed
4. **Admin deletes admin**: Admin account is removed (by another admin)

### ‚ùå Prevented Operations
1. **Admin changes own role**: Blocked with error message
2. **Admin deletes own account**: Blocked with error message
3. **Customer accesses endpoint**: 403 Forbidden
4. **Invalid role specified**: 400 Bad Request

### üîÑ Edge Cases
1. **Last admin demoted**: Ensure system still has admin access
2. **Network failure during operation**: Graceful error handling
3. **Concurrent modifications**: Database consistency maintained
4. **Invalid user ID**: Proper error handling

## Implementation Details

## Future Enhancements

### üöÄ Planned Features

### üîí Additional Recommendations
1. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of admin endpoints
2. **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout for inactive admins
3. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for admin accounts
4. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict admin access to specific IPs
5. **Backup Systems**: Regular backups before user deletions

## Deployment Considerations

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Test all role change scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Toast not appearing**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. **Buttons not responding**: Verify admin authentication
3. **Role changes not persisting**: Check database connection
4. **Self-modification allowed**: Report as critical security bug

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser network tab for failed requests
2. Verify admin token in browser cookies
3. Check server logs for error messages
4. Confirm database connectivity

## Success Metrics

### üìà Key Performance Indicators
- User management operations per day
- Error rate for admin operations
- Time to complete user management tasks
- Admin user satisfaction surveys
- System uptime during operations

### üéØ Success Criteria
